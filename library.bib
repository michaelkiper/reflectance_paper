   abstract = {Determining the intrinsic dimension of a hyperspectral image is an important step in the spectral unmixing process and under-or overestimation of this number may lead to incorrect unmixing in unsupervised methods. In this paper, we discuss a new method for determining the intrinsic dimension using recent advances in random matrix theory. This method is entirely unsupervised, free from any user-determined parameters and allows spectrally correlated noise in the data. Robustness tests are run on synthetic data, to determine how the results were affected by noise levels, noise variability, noise approximation, and spectral characteristics of the endmembers. Success rates are determined for many different synthetic images, and the method is tested on two pairs of real images, namely a Cuprite scene taken from Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and SpecTIR sensors, and a Lunar Lakes scene taken from AVIRIS and Hyperion, with good results. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {We present a new method for more accurate in-flight calibration and correction of imaging spectrometer spectral response functions. Non-Gaussian tails of spectral response functions can be difficult to characterize in the laboratory, and calibration can shift during deployment. Consequently, in-flight techniques are useful for validating and updating laboratory measurements. Our approach exploits predictable changes in the shape of the oxygen A band across varying surface elevation, with diverse scene content providing numerical leverage to characterize spectral response tails 3–4 orders of magnitude below the peak. We present a correction to recover the nominal response function, and show case studies based on NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). Corrected radiances are better conditioned for downstream analysis by sensitive atmospheric codes. We evaluate accuracy using multiple independent standards: simulation studies; consistency with laboratory measurements; elimination of a surface pressure retrieval bias; better alignment of retrieved reflectance with ground reference data; and statistics of over 250 flightlines from a campaign across the Indian Subcontinent showing consistent improvements in atmospheric correction.},

   abstract = {With very high spectral resolution, hyperspectral sensors can now uncover many unknown signal sources which cannot be identified by visual inspection or a priori. In order to account for such unknown signal sources, we introduce a new definition, referred to as virtual dimensionality (VD) in this paper. It is defined as the minimum number of spectrally distinct signal sources that characterize the hyperspectral data from the perspective view of target detection and classification. It is different from the commonly used intrinsic dimensionality (ID) in the sense that the signal sources are determined by the proposed VD based only on their distinct spectral properties. These signal sources may include unknown interfering sources, which cannot be identified by prior knowledge. With this new definition, three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods are developed to determine the VD of hyperspectral imagery, where eigenvalues are used to measure signal energies in a detection model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, two information criteria, an information criterion (AIC) and minimum description length (MDL), and the factor analysis-based method proposed by Malinowski, are considered for comparative analysis. As demonstrated in computer simulations, all the methods and criteria studied in this paper may work effectively when noise is independent identically distributed. This is, unfortunately, not true when some of them are applied to real image data. Experiments show that all the three eigenthresholding based methods (i.e., the Harsanyi-Farrand-Chang (HFC), the noise-whitened HFC (NWHFC), and the noise subspace projection (NSP) methods) produce more reliable estimates of VD compared to the AIC, MDL, and Malinowski's empirical indicator function, which generally overestimate VD significantly. In summary, three contributions are made in this paper, 1) an introduction of the new definition of VD, 2) three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods, HFC, NWHFC, and NSP derived for VD estimation, and 3) experiments that show the AIC and MDL commonly used in passive array processing and the second-order statistic-based Malinowski's method are not effective measures in VD estimation.},

Our approach fits a combined model of atmospheric scattering, absorption, and surface reflectance across the solar reflected interval from 380 to 2500 nm. This can estimate spectrally-broad atmospheric perturbations such as aerosol effects that are difficult to retrieve with narrow spectral windows. A probabilistic formulation from Optimal Estimation inversion theory accounts for uncertainties in model parameters and measurement noise. This paper presents a field experiment using NASA's Next Generation Visible/Near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) with analysis of retrieval accuracy and information content. The inversion outperforms traditional approaches, achieving mean reflectance accuracy of 1.0% on diverse validation surfaces. Predicted posterior distributions fully explain the observed discrepancies, demonstrating the first closed uncertainty budget for VSWIR imaging spectrometer atmospheric correction. This shows the potential of combined surface/atmosphere fitting to advance the accuracy and statistical rigor of remote reflectance measurements.},

In this study Airborne AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data were used to identify the different altered, weathered and clay group of minerals in the Jahajpur, Bhilwara, India. In the study area, different hydrothermal minerals such as Montmorillonite, Smectite and Talc were identified. Apart from this, Goethite/Limonite mineral spectral signatures were identified using the AVIRIS-NG data in the VNIR (visible and near infrared) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Minerals thus identified were verified by the conventional geological analysis viz. petrography and XRD of the field samples collected from the study area. The results of the conventional geological methods and spectroscopy were in good confirmation with the results found through the analysis of the AVIRIS-NG data. Identified minerals show a good indication of the advance argillic alteration in the study area which stand in confirmation with the geology of the area.

   abstract = {Emissions estimates of anthropogenic methane (CH4) sources are highly uncertain and many sources related to energy production are localized yet difficult to quantify. Airborne imaging spectrometers like the next generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) are well suited for locating CH4 point sources due to their ability to map concentrations over large regions with the high spatial resolution necessary to resolve localized emissions. AVIRIS-NG was deployed during a field campaign to measure controlled CH4 releases at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) in Wyoming, U.S. for multiple flux rates and flight altitudes. Two algorithms were applied to AVIRIS-NG scenes, a matched filter detection algorithm and a hybrid retrieval approach using the Iterative Maximum a Posteriori Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) algorithm and Singular Value Decomposition. Plumes for releases as low as 14.16 m3/h (0.09 kt/year) were consistently observed by AVIRIS-NG at multiple flight altitudes and images of plumes were in agreement with wind directions measured at ground stations. In some cases plumes as low as 3.40 m3/h (0.02 kt/year) were detected, indicating that AVIRIS-NG has the capability of detecting a wide range of fugitive CH4 source categories for natural gas fields. This controlled release experiment is the first of its kind using AVIRIS-NG and demonstrates the utility of imaging spectrometers for direct attribution of emissions to individual point source locations. This is particularly useful given the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic CH4 emissions, including those from industry, gas transmission lines, and the oil and gas sectors.},

   abstract = {The reflectance spectra of minerals are studied as a function of spectral resolution in the range from 0.2 to 3.0 μm. Selected absorption bands were studied at resolving powers (λ/Δλ) as high as 2240. At resolving powers of approximately 1000, many OH-bearing minerals show diagnostic sharp absorptions at the resolution limit. At low resolution, some minerals may not be distinguishable, but as the resolution is increased, most can be easily identified. As the resolution is increased, many minerals show fine structure, particularly in the OH-stretching overtone region near 1.4 μm. The fine structure can enhance the ability to discriminate between minerals, and in some cases the fine structure can be used to determine elemental composition. The study shows that high-resolution reflectance spectroscopy of minerals may prove to be a very important tool in the laboratory, in the field using field-portable spectrometers, from aircraft, and from satellites looking at Earth or other planetary surfaces. -from Authors},

Previous reviews have focused on the ability of remote sensing to map the structure and habitat composition of coral reefs, but have neglected to consider the physical environment in which reefs occur. We provide a holistic review of what can, might, and cannot be mapped using remote sensing at this time. We cover aspects of reef structure and health but also discuss the diversity of physical environmental data such as temperature, winds, solar radiation and water quality. There have been numerous recent advances in the remote sensing of reefs and we hope that this paper enhances awareness of the diverse data sources available, and helps practitioners identify realistic objectives for remote sensing in coral reef areas. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

With the aim of preparing for this new era of Earth observation, this review summarizes the state-of-the-art retrieval methods that have been applied in experimental imaging spectroscopy studies inferring all kinds of vegetation biophysical variables. Identified retrieval methods are categorized into: (1) parametric regression, including vegetation indices, shape indices and spectral transformations; (2) nonparametric regression, including linear and nonlinear machine learning regression algorithms; (3) physically based, including inversion of radiative transfer models (RTMs) using numerical optimization and look-up table approaches; and (4) hybrid regression methods, which combine RTM simulations with machine learning regression methods. For each of these categories, an overview of widely applied methods with application to mapping vegetation properties is given. In view of processing imaging spectroscopy data, a critical aspect involves the challenge of dealing with spectral multicollinearity.

This campaign was organized under the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) joint initiative for HYperSpectral Imaging (HYSI) programme. To support the campaign, synchronous field campaigns and ground measurements were also carried out over these sites spanning themes related to crop, soil, forest, geology, coastal, ocean, river water, snow, urban, etc. AVIRIS-NG measures the spectral range from 380 to 2510 nm at 5 nm sampling with a ground sampling distance ranging from 4 to 8 m and flight altitude of 4-8 km. On-board and ground-based calibration and processing were carried out to generate level 0 (L0) and level 1 (L1) products respectively. An atmospheric correction scheme has been developed to convert the measured radiances to surface reflectance (level 2). These spectroscopic signatures are intended to discriminate surface types and retrieve physical and compositional parameters for the study of terrestrial , aquatic and atmospheric properties. The results from this campaign will support a range of objectives, including demonstration of advanced applications for societal benefits, validation of models/techniques, development of state-of-the-art spectral libraries, testing and refinement of automated tools for users, and definition of requirements for future space-based missions that can provide this class of measurements routinely for a range of important applications.},

   abstract = {The Arctic is currently undergoing intense changes in climate; vegetation composition and productivity are expected to respond to such changes. To understand the impacts of climate change on the function of Arctic tundra ecosystems within the global carbon cycle, it is crucial to improve the understanding of vegetation distribution and heterogeneity at multiple scales. Information detailing the fine-scale spatial distribution of tundra communities provided by high resolution vegetation mapping, is needed to understand the relative contributions of and relationships between single vegetation community measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes (e.g., ~1 m chamber flux) and those encompassing multiple vegetation communities (e.g., ~300 m eddy covariance measurements). The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine whether dominant Arctic tundra vegetation communities found in different locations are spectrally distinct and distinguishable using field spectroscopy methods; and (2) to test which combination of raw reflectance and vegetation indices retrieved from field and satellite data resulted in accurate vegetation maps and whether these were transferable across locations to develop a systematic method to map dominant vegetation communities within larger eddy covariance tower footprints distributed along a 300 km transect in northern Alaska. We showed vegetation community separability primarily in the 450-510 nm, 630-690 nm and 705-745 nm regions of the spectrum with the field spectroscopy data. This is line with the different traits of these arctic tundra communities, with the drier, often non-vascular plant dominated communities having much higher reflectance in the 450-510 nm and 630-690 nm regions due to the lack of photosynthetic material, whereas the low reflectance values of the vascular plant dominated communities highlight the strong light absorption found here. High classification accuracies of 92% to 96% were achieved using linear discriminant analysis with raw and rescaled spectroscopy reflectance data and derived vegetation indices. However, lower classification accuracies (~70%) resulted when using the coarser 2.0 m WorldView-2 data inputs. The results from this study suggest that tundra vegetation communities are separable using plot-level spectroscopy with hand-held sensors. These results also show that tundra vegetation mapping can be scaled from the plot level (<1 m) to patch level (<500 m) using spectroscopy data rescaled to match the wavebands of the multispectral satellite remote sensing. We find that developing a consistent method for classification of vegetation communities across the flux tower sites is a challenging process, given thespatial variability in vegetation communities and the need for detailed vegetation survey data for training and validating classification algorithms. This study highlights the benefits of using fine-scale field spectroscopy measurements to obtain tundra vegetation classifications for landscape analyses and use in carbon flux scaling studies. Improved understanding of tundra vegetation distributions will also provide necessary insight into the ecological processes driving plant community assemblages in Arctic environments.},

Accurate knowledge of the spatial distribution of dominant plant species and PFTs is highly valuable to many scientific and management goals, including improved parameterization of ecosystem process and climate models, better invasive species distribution monitoring and forecasting, quantification of human and natural disturbance and recovery processes, and evaluations of terrestrial vegetation response to climate change. Most often, species-level discrimination has been achieved using fine spatial resolution (≤. 20 m) airborne imagery, but currently proposed spaceborne imaging spectrometers will have coarser spatial resolution (~. 30 to 60 m). In order to address the impact of coarser spatial resolutions on our ability to spectrally separate species and PFTs, we classified dominant species and PFTs in five contrasting ecosystems over a range of spatial resolutions. Study sites included a temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, a brackish tidal marsh, a mixed conifer/broadleaf montane forest, a temperate rainforest and a Mediterranean climate region encompassing grasslands, oak savanna, oak woodland and shrublands. Data were acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over each site, and spatially aggregated to 20, 40 and 60 m resolutions. Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) was used to classify species and PFTs at each site and across scales with overall accuracies ranging from 61 to 96% for species and 83-100% for PFTs. The results of this study show accuracy increases at coarser resolutions (≥. 20 m) across ecosystems, supporting the use of imaging spectroscopy data at spatial resolutions up to 60 m for the purpose of discriminating among plant species and PFTs. In four of the five study sites, the best accuracies were achieved at 40 m resolution. However, at coarser resolutions, some fine-scale species variation is lost and classes that occur only in small patches cannot be mapped. We also demonstrate that spectral libraries developed from fine spatial resolution imagery can be successfully applied as training data to accurately classify coarser resolution data over multiple ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Remote-sensing systems typically produce imagery that averages information over tens or even hundreds of square meters - far too coarse to detect most organisms - so the remote sensing of biodiversity would appear to be a fool's errand. However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.},

   abstract = {With very high spectral resolution, hyperspectral sensors can now uncover many unknown signal sources which cannot be identified by visual inspection or a priori. In order to account for such unknown signal sources, we introduce a new definition, referred to as virtual dimensionality (VD) in this paper. It is defined as the minimum number of spectrally distinct signal sources that characterize the hyperspectral data from the perspective view of target detection and classification. It is different from the commonly used intrinsic dimensionality (ID) in the sense that the signal sources are determined by the proposed VD based only on their distinct spectral properties. These signal sources may include unknown interfering sources, which cannot be identified by prior knowledge. With this new definition, three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods are developed to determine the VD of hyperspectral imagery, where eigenvalues are used to measure signal energies in a detection model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, two information criteria, an information criterion (AIC) and minimum description length (MDL), and the factor analysis-based method proposed by Malinowski, are considered for comparative analysis. As demonstrated in computer simulations, all the methods and criteria studied in this paper may work effectively when noise is independent identically distributed. This is, unfortunately, not true when some of them are applied to real image data. Experiments show that all the three eigenthresholding based methods (i.e., the Harsanyi-Farrand-Chang (HFC), the noise-whitened HFC (NWHFC), and the noise subspace projection (NSP) methods) produce more reliable estimates of VD compared to the AIC, MDL, and Malinowski's empirical indicator function, which generally overestimate VD significantly. In summary, three contributions are made in this paper, 1) an introduction of the new definition of VD, 2) three Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods, HFC, NWHFC, and NSP derived for VD estimation, and 3) experiments that show the AIC and MDL commonly used in passive array processing and the second-order statistic-based Malinowski's method are not effective measures in VD estimation.},

The solar-reflected regime spans the 0.38 - 2.5 μm interval, and is captured by a wide range of current and planned instruments on both airborne and orbital platforms. To date there has been no systematic study of its spectral dimensionality as a function of space, time, and land cover. Here we report a multi-site, multi-year statistical survey by NASA's "Classic" Airborne Visible Near InfraRed Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C). AVIRIS-C measured large regions of California, USA, spanning wide latitudinal and elevation gradients containing all canonical MODIS land cover types. The spectral uniformity of the AVIRIS-C design enabled consistent in-scene assessment of measurement noise across acquisitions. The estimated dimensionality as a function of cover type ranged from the low 20s to the high 40s, and was approximately 50 for the combined dataset. This result indicates the high diversity of physical processes distinguishable by imaging spectrometers like AVIRIS-C for one region of the Earth.},

   abstract = {An endmember is an idealized, pure signature for a class and provides crucial information for hyperspectral image analysis. Recently, endmember extraction has received considerable attention in hyperspectral imaging due to significantly improved spectral resolution where the likelihood of a hyperspectral image pixel uncovered by a hyperspectral image sensor as an endmember is substantially increased. Many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. One great challenge in endmember extraction is the determination of number of endmembers, p required for an endmember extraction algorithm (EEA) to generate. Unfortunately, this issue has been overlooked and avoided by making an empirical assumption without justification. However, it has been shown that an appropriate selection of p is critical to success in extracting desired endmembers from image data. This paper explores methods available in the literature that can be used to estimate the value, p. These include the commonly used eigenvalue-based energy method, An Information criterion (AIC), Minimum Description Length (MDL), Gershgorin radii-based method, Signal Subspace Estimation (SSE) and Neyman-Pearson detection method in detection theory. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, two sets of experiments are conducted for performance analysis. The first set consists of synthetic image-based simulations which allow us to evaluate their performance with a priori knowledge, while the second set comprising of real hyperspectral image experiments which demonstrate utility of these methods in real applications.},

@article{Wu1995,
   abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the effective uses of Gerschgorin radii of the unitary transformed covariance matrix for source number estimation. There are two approaches, likelihood and heuristic, used for developing the detection criteria. The likelihood approach combines the Gerschgorin radii to the well-known source number detectors and improves their detection performances for Gaussian and white noise processes. It is verified that the Gerschgorin likelihood estimators (GLE) are consistent. The Gerschgorin AIC yields a consistent estimate and the Gerschgorin MDL criterion does not tend to underestimate at small or moderate data samples. The heuristic approach applying the Gerschgorin disk estimator (GDE) developed from the projection concept, overcomes the problem in cases of small data samples, an unknown noise model, and data dependency. Furthermore, the detection performances of both approaches through the suggested rotations and averaging can be further improved. Finally, the proposed and existing criteria are evaluated in various conditions by using simulated and measured experimental data. © 1995 IEEE},

The classical maximurn likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AlC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

Discrepancies between RTM assumptions and physical reality can cause systematic errors in surface property estimates. We present a statistical method to quantify these model errors without invoking ground reference data. Our approach exploits scene invariants — properties of the environment which are stable over space or time — to estimate RTM discrepancies. We describe techniques for discovering these features opportunistically in flight data. We then demonstrate data-driven methods that estimate the aggregate errors due to model discrepancies without having to explicitly identify the underlying physical mechanisms. The resulting distributions can improve posterior uncertainty predictions in operational retrievals.},

   abstract = {The distributions of the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of a p-variate sample covariance matrix S are of great importance in statistics. Focusing on the null case where nS follows the standard Wishart distribution W p(I, n), we study the accuracy of their scaling limits under the setting: n/p→ γ ∈ (0, ∞) as n → ∞. The limits here are the orthogonal Tracy-Widom law and its reflection about the origin. With carefully chosen rescaling constants, the approximation to the rescaled largest eigenvalue distribution by the limit attains accuracy of order O(min(n, p) 2/3). If γ > 1, the same order of accuracy is obtained for the smallest eigenvalue after incorporating an additional log transform. Numerical results show that the relative error of approximation at conventional significance levels is reduced by over 50% in rectangular and over 75% in 'thin' data matrix settings, even with min(n, p) as small as 2. © 2012 ISI/BS.},
